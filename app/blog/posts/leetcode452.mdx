## 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [x_start, x_end]` denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between `x_start` and `x_end`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `x_start` and `x_end` is burst by an arrow shot at `x` if `x_start <= x <= x_end`. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.


Example 1
`````
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
`````

Example 3
`````
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
`````


Constraints:

- `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-2^31 <= x_start < x_end <= 2^31 - 1`


## Solution
Approach 1: Greedy
````JAVA
/**
 * Time Complexity: O(NlogN) - Sorting takes O(NlogN) time.
 * Space Complexity: O(N) - Java `Arrays.sort` uses Timsort for object arrays, requiring O(N) extra space.
 * If sorting were done using QuickSort (for primitive arrays like int[]), then O(logN) space complexity could apply.
 */
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        int num_of_arrow = 1;
        Arrays.sort(points, (o1, o2) -> Integer.compare(o1[0], o2[0]));
        int end = points[0][1];

        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (end >= points[i][0]) {
                end = Math.min(end, points[i][1]);
            }
            else {
                end = points[i][1];
                num_of_arrow++;
            }     
        }
        return num_of_arrow;
    }
}
