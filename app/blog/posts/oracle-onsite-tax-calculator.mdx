## Tax Calculator
Given below table is a tax contract. The rate is not fixed, and it could change every year.
You can assume getTax() will return a result in any format. Write a method to calculate the tax.

```
| Income             | Rate |
| :-----             | ---: |
| $0 - $10,000       | 10%  |
| $10,000 - $20,000  | 20%  |
| $20,000 - $30,000  | 25%  |
| $30,000 - 50,000   | 30%  |
```

Assumption: 
1. The getTax() returns income should be in order
2. The getTax() returns income must continuously 

Follow up: 
- What if the returns income is unordered?
- Could we do in O(1) if we change the assumption of getTax()?
 
## Solution
Approach 1:
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
public class Solution {
    public double tax(double income) {
		
		List<Tax> arrayList = getTax();
		double tax = 0;
		
		for (int i = 0; i < arrayList.size(); i++) {
				if (income > arrayList.get(0).income) {
						tax += (income - arrayList.get(0).income) * arrayList.get(0).rate;
						income = arrayList.get(0).income;
				}
		}
		return tax;
    }
}
