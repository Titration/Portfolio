## 58. Length of Last Word
Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

(A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.)


Example 1
`````
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
`````

Example 3
`````
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
`````

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be at least one word in `s`.

## Solution
Approach 1: Reverse loop
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        
        int length = 0;

        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != ' ') {
                length++;
            }
            else { // it's a white space instead
                //  Did we already started to count a word ? Yes so we found the last word
                if (length > 0) return length;
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
}
