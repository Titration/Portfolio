## Common Email Addresses

Write a function to find the email address you and I share.

Given two lists of emails you are tasked with completing the method provided called `commonEmails`.

`commonEmails` is expected to respond a collection of emails that exist in common between the two input lists, you, and I.

You are free to change all aspects of the method.


## Solution
Approach 1: [Two pointers]
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
public class CommonEmailAddresses {

    public static Object commonEmails(Object myEmails, Object yourEmails) {
        if (!(myEmails instanceof List) || !(yourEmails instanceof List)){
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Inputs must be lists of strings");
        }

        List<String> myList = (List<String>)myEmails;
        List<String> yourList = (List<String>)yourEmails;
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();

        Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (String item : myList) {
            hashSet.add(item);
        }
        for (String item : yourList) {
            if (hashSet.contains(item)) {
                result.add(item);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object yourEmails = Arrays.asList("a@a.com", "b@b.com", "c@c.com");
        Object myEmails = Arrays.asList("b@b.com", "c@c.com");
        System.out.println(commonEmails(yourEmails, myEmails));
    }
}
