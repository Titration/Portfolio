## 2529. Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer

Given an array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers.

In other words, if the number of positive integers in `nums` is `pos` and the number of negative integers is `neg`, then return the maximum of `pos` and `neg`.

Note that `0` is neither positive nor negative.


Example 1
`````
Input: nums = [-2,-1,-1,1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: nums = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 2 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
`````

Example 3
`````
Input: nums = [5,20,66,1314]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 positive integers and 0 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 4.
`````


Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
- `-2000 <= nums[i] <= 2000`
- `nums` is sorted in a non-decreasing order.

## Solution
Approach 1: Binary Search
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(log(n))
// Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int maximumCount(int[] nums) {
        int pos = nums.length - binarySearchPositive(nums);
        int neg = binarySearchNegative(nums) + 1;
        return Math.max(pos, neg);
    }
    public int binarySearchPositive(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            else if (nums[mid] > 1) {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    public int binarySearchNegative(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == -1) {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            else if (nums[mid] > -1) {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
