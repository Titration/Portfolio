## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.


Example 1
`````
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
`````


Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`


## Solution
Approach 1: HashSet

Idea: Image to separate the items as different consecutive sequences.

Eg. nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
- `Separate items into 3 sequences, such as 1___...__100__...__200__`
- `NotFound <- left_100: length = 1`
- `NotFound <- left_200: length = 1`
- `NotFound <- left_1: keep searching 1_right, length++`

````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        
        int longest = 0;
        Set<Integer> hashset = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i : nums) {
            hashset.add(i);
        }
        for (int item : hashset) {
            if (!hashset.contains(item - 1)) {
                int value = item;
                int count = 1;
                while (hashset.contains(value + 1)) {
                    value++;
                    count++;
                }
                longest = Math.max(count, longest);
            }            
        }
        return longest;
    }
}
