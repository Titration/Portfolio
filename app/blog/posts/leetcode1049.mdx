## 1049. Last Stone Weight II

You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `ith` stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.


Example 1
`````
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]
Output: 5
`````


Constraints:

- `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
- `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`


## Solution
Approach 1: Dynamic Programming, 2D Array
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(m * n) (n is number of stones[], m is target)
// Space complexity: O(m * n)
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int weight : stones) {
            sum += weight;
        }
        int target = sum / 2;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[stones.length][target + 1];
        for (int j = stones[0]; j <= target; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = stones[0];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < stones.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < target + 1; j++) {
                if (stones[i] > j) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - stones[i]] + stones[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        return sum - 2 * (dp[stones.length - 1][target]);
    }
}
