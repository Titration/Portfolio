## 450. Delete Node in a BST

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.


Example 1
`````
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
`````

Example 3
`````
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
`````


Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- Each node has a unique value.
- `root` is a valid binary search tree.
- `-10^5 <= key <= 10^5`


## Solution
What I did wrong when I program:
````JAVA
TreeNode curr = root.right;
while (curr != null) {
    curr = curr.left;
}
curr = root.left;
````
This is wrong because of `curr = root.left;`

This only reassigns the reference curr to point to root.left. It does not modify the actual structure of the tree. In Java, assigning a variable (e.g., curr) to another reference (e.g., root.left) simply changes what the variable curr is pointing to; it doesnâ€™t change any connections between the nodes in the tree.

````JAVA
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        
        if (root.val == key) {
            if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
                return null;
            }
            else if (root.left == null && root.right != null) {
                return root.right;
            }
            else if (root.left != null && root.right == null ) {
                return root.left;
            }
            else if (root.left != null && root.right != null) {
                TreeNode curr = root.right;
                while (curr.left != null) {
                    curr = curr.left;
                }
                curr.left = root.left;
                return root.right;
            }
        }
        if (root.val > key) {
            root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
        }
        else {
            root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
        }

        return root;
    }
