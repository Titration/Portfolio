## 344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array `in-place` with `O(1)` extra memory.

(An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size.)

Example 1
`````
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
`````

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.

## Solution
Approach 1: Two pointers
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
````

Approach 2: Bit operation
````JAVA
//Time complexity: O(n)
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            s[left] ^= s[right];
            s[right] ^= s[left];
            s[left] ^= s[right];
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
