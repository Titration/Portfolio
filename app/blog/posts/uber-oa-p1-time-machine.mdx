## Time Machine
Imagine that you have a time machine. You are given an array `years`. You start in the year `years[0]`. First, you want to travel to `years[1]`, then to `years[2]`, and so on.
Your task is to calculate the time required to visit all the years from the list in order.

The time required to travel from the year a to the year is calculated as follows:
- 0 hours if `A = B`
- 1 hour if `A < B` (going forwards in time)
- 2 hours if `A > B` (going backwards in time)

Note: You are not exprected to provide the most optimal solution, but a solution with time complexity not worse than `O(years.length ^ 3)` will fit within the execution time limit.

Example 1
`````
For `years = [2000, 1990, 2005, 2050]`, the output should be `solution (years) = 4`.
First you go from `2000` to `1990` , which requires `2` hours.
Then you go from `1990` to `2005`, which requires `1` hour.
Then you go from `2005` to `2050`, which requires `1` hour.
In total, you need `2 + 1 + 1 = 4` hours.
`````

Example 2
`````
For `years = [2000, 2021, 2005]`, the output should be `solution(years) = 3`.
First, you go from `2000` to `2021` , which requires `1` hour.
Then you go from `2021` to `2005`, which requires `2` hours.
In total, you need `1 + 2 = 3` hours.
`````

Example 3
`````
For `years = [2021, 2021, 2005]`, the output should be `solution(years) = 2`.
First, you go from `2021` to `2021`, which requires `0` hours as the trip takes place within the same year.
Then you go from `2021` to `2005`, which requires `2` hours.
In total, you need `0 + 2 = 2` hours.
`````

## Solution
Approach 1:
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
public class TimeMachine {
    public static int totalHours(int[] years) {
        
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < years.length; i++) {
            if (years[i-1] == years[i]) { // A == B
                continue;
            }
            else if (years[i-1] < years[i]) { // A < B
                result += 1;
            }
            else if (years[i-1] > years[i]) { // A > B
                result += 2;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] years = new int[] {2000, 1990, 2005, 2050};
        int result = totalHours(years);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
