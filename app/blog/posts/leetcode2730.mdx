## 2730. Find the Longest Semi-Repetitive Substring

You are given a digit string `s` that consists of digits from 0 to 9.

A string is called semi-repetitive if there is at most one adjacent pair of the same digit. For example, `"0010"`, `"002020"`, `"0123"`, `"2002"`, and `"54944"` are semi-repetitive while the following are not: `"00101022"` (adjacent same digit pairs are 00 and 22), and `"1101234883"` (adjacent same digit pairs are 11 and 88).

Return the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring of `s`.


Example 1
`````
Input: s = "52233"

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest semi-repetitive substring is "5223". Picking the whole string "52233" has two adjacent same digit pairs 22 and 33, but at most one is allowed.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: s = "5494"

Output: 4

Explanation:

`s` is a semi-repetitive string.
`````

Example 3
`````
Input: s = "1111111"

Output: 2

Explanation:

The longest semi-repetitive substring is "11". Picking the substring "111" has two adjacent same digit pairs, but at most one is allowed.
`````


Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 50`
- `'0' <= s[i] <= '9'`


## Solution
Approach 1: Sliding Window (Unfixed Length)
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(String s) {
        
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        int result = 1;
        int left = 0;
        int countSemi = 0;

        for (int right = 1; right < c.length; right++) {
            if (c[right - 1] == c[right]) { countSemi++; }
            /*
            while (countSemi == 2) {
                if (c[left + 1] == c[left]) {
                    countSemi--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            */
            if (countSemi > 1) {
                left++;
                while (c[left - 1] != c[left]) {
                    left++;
                }
                countSemi = 1;
            }
            result = Math.max(result, right - left + 1);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
