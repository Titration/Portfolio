## 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

You are given an integer array cost where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.


Example 1
`````
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
`````


Constraints:

- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`


## Solution
Approach 1: Dynamic Programming with Array
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int[] dp = new int[cost.length];
        dp[0] = cost[0];
        dp[1] = cost[1];

        for (int i = 2; i < cost.length; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - 2], dp[i - 1]) + cost[i];
        }
        return Math.min(dp[cost.length - 2], dp[cost.length - 1]);
    }
}
````

Approach 1.2: Dynamic Programming without Array
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {

        int dp0 = cost[0];
        int dp1 = cost[1];

        for (int i = 2; i < cost.length; i++) {
            int dpi = Math.min(dp0, dp1) + cost[i];
            dp0 = dp1;
            dp1 = dpi;
        }
        return Math.min(dp0, dp1);
    }
}
````


Approach 2: Dynamic Programming with Array
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int[] dp = new int[cost.length + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i <= cost.length; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2], dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1]);
        }
        return dp[cost.length];
    }

            dp0 = dp1;
