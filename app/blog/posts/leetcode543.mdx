## 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


Example 1
`````
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
`````


Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`


## Solution
Approach 1: DFS (Depth First Search)
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
