## 409. Longest Palindrome

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest 
palindrome that can be built with those letters.

(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.)

Letters are case sensitive, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome.


Example 1
`````
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
`````


Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.


## Solution
Approach 1: Hash Map
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String s) {
        
        int longest = 0;
        int[] map = new int[26*2];
        char[] array = s.toCharArray();
        
        for (char item : array) {
            if (Character.isUpperCase(item)) {
                map[item - 'A']++;
            }
            else {
                map[item - 'a' + 26]++;
            }
        }

        for (int item : map) {
            if (item % 2 == 0) {
                longest += item;
            }
            else {    
                longest += item - 1;
            }
        }

        return longest == s.length() ? longest : longest + 1;
    }
}
