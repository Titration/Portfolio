## 9. Palindrome Number
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

Example 1
`````
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
`````

Example 3
`````
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
`````

Constraints:

- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Solution
Approach 1: Math
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        
        if (x < 0) { return false; }

        int temp = x;
        int reserved = 0;
        while (temp > 0) {
            int digit = temp % 10;
            reserved = reserved * 10 + digit;
            temp = temp / 10;
        }
        
        return (reserved == x);
    }
}
