## 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


Example 1
`````
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
`````

Example 2
`````
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
`````

Example 3
`````
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
`````


Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are unique.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.


## Solution
Approach 1: Iteration
````JAVA
// Time complexity: O(n)
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        
        while (root != null) {
            if (root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) { // left
                root = root.left;
            }
            else if (root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val) { // right
                root = root.right;
            }
            else {
                return root;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
````

Approach 2: Recursion
````JAVA
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        
        if (root == null) return null;

        if (root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) {
            TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
            if (left != null) {
                return left;
            }
        }
        if (root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val) {
            TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
            if (right != null) {
                return right;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
