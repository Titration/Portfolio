## Binary Search

### Understand interval `[]` and `()`.
```
[a, b] is inclusive interval, a <= x <= b
(a, b) is exclusive interval, a < x < b. 
eg: (1,5) = 1 < x < 5 = 2 <= x <= 4 = [2, 4]
```

### How to avoid Integer overflow in Binary Search?
```
int mid = (left + right) / 2;
```
We can convert it to:
````
int mid 
= left / 2 + right / 2 
= (left - left / 2) + right / 2 
= left + right / 2 - left / 2
= left + (right - left) / 2;
````
